            <p>
              I began programming in 2020 at the age of 13 with Scratch, which was both fun and engaging. Later, I took a robotics class but found it challenging and lost interest. At 15, I rediscovered programming with HTML and CSS and fell in love with web development. Although I took a break due to school, I resumed coding and have since developed skills in Python and JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently, I am a Year 12 student pursuing an IT qualification at <a href="https:\\sccb.ac.uk">college (sixth-form)</a>. My focus is on building projects and advancing my programming skills, especially in React.js and JavaScript. Recently, I was accepted as a Software Engineering Intern at <a href="https://headstarter.co/">Headstarter AI</a>, where I will contribute to an open-source project.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the next 2-3 years, I aim to become a proficient Software Engineer with expertise in various programming languages, libraries, and frameworks.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I'm not coding, I enjoy watching series, and reflecting on self-improvement—all while listening to my <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2Er4AgHcySgH6VjP1z1Zq1?si=a46621f335b4469c">favorite playlist</a>.

                <p class="exp-description">
                  At Headstarter, I undertook an intensive fellowship where I developed five AI projects over five weeks.
                  As a capstone to this experience, I wiil be contributing an accepted pull request (PR) to an open-source community.
                  This fellowship was particularly exciting as it provided me with the opportunity to hone my skills in various key areas, including Vision, Network Building, Project Management, Teamwork/Collaboration, and Presentation.
